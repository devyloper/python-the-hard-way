# python-the-hard-way
This is the repository where I share what I learn from the book "Learn Python The Hard Way".
I understand python but it's been almost 1.5 years since I used python in a project. 
My Goal is to brush up the fundamentals in 10-15 Days and then jump onto building personal projects and start contributing to python related projects.
